I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Hong Kong, working under the supervision of Prof. Xuhua He. I received my Ph.D. in Pure Mathematics from the Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the supervision of Prof. Binyong Sun.  
My name in Chinese : 耿智斌.  
**Email** : gengzhibin@amss.ac.cn  
Here is my [<u>CV</u>](./CV251010.pdf).

## Research
My research interests lie in Representation Theory of real and p-adic Lie groups, as well as its connection to the (classical and relative) Langlands program.
